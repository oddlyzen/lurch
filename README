Lurch is a IRC bot for tasks and interruptions using the Slim Timer API. The name has a double-meaning, as it references the Addams' Family character of the same name.

Lurch was the Addams butler, but they treated him as part of the family. He was fast--sometimes demonstrating a prescience that was uncanny and entertaining. Always answering with a faithful, "You *rang*?"  Lurch is meant to do that for you in your favorite IRC channel.  Ours is #zepinvest (chat.us.freenode.net).

The second meaning for Lurch comes from a Web search:
  # stagger: walk as if unable to control one's movements; "The drunken man staggered into the room"
  # move abruptly; "The ship suddenly lurched to the left"
  # an unsteady uneven gait
  # prowl: loiter about, with no apparent aim
  # the act of moving forward suddenly (http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn)

That's how our workflow sometimes goes. We start coding, and suddenly someone walks up on us and clears their throat.  Interrupt! And then we lose the flow and everything generally goes to shit. To prove that point to disbelievers (mainly the people who interrupt us), we wanted a way to easily:
  # let people know what task I was currently working on
  # track the amount of time I spend on the task
  # tag the task for filtering
  # allow for multiple tasks to be stacked (multiple tasks on one clock)
  # allow for interruptions quickly--and track *that* time, too.

Lurch all that.  All you need to do is get a free account on Slim Timer (http://slimtimer.com). Once you login, you will see a tab named 'API'. Click on that and get yourself an API key.  It's fast. It's free. It's legal. It's fun.  Then you just need to add a config.yml file to Lurch's root directory.  It's contents should be something like:

--- 
st_password: password
st_user: user@your.com
st_api_key: eaxx7258085x816x1xx0fcxcxde69x

about_msg: 'You *rang*?'
